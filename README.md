# Would You Rather Project

This is my project submission for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that is used to access the data. 

## Getting Started

Install the following dependencies using node.js before running:

- npm i react-redux
- npm i redux
- npm i antd
- npm i redux-thunk
- npm i react-router-dom
- npm i react-router

Once installed use npm start to start the app.

### How To Use

Choose a user to load the Dashboard. On there you will se Answered Questions and Unanswered Questions.

In the navigation bar, you will be able to Submit A Poll and view the Leaderboard. Switch between users in order to see
questions submitted by other users.
